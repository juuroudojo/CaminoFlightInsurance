# HABA - Making Travel Industry Friendlier
HABA is a blockchain-based infrastructure that aims to make the travel industry friendlier by revolutionizing the way airline tickets are purchased, managed, and validated. Our decentralized system provides a secure and transparent solution that eliminates inefficiencies, reduces costs, and enhances the overall travel experience for both airlines and travelers.

The airline industry faces several challenges, including high fees, slow processes, lack of transparency, and fraudulent activities. Traditional ticket purchasing, management, and validation systems rely on intermediaries, leading to increased costs and complexities. Moreover, the insurance industry associated with travel often lacks transparency and trust, leading to disputes and delays in claim settlements.

# Our Solution
HABA is built on Camino, a powerful and secure blockchain platform, to address these issues and provide a more efficient and secure system for the airline and insurance industry. KYC/KYB verification requirement for both developers and users opens up possibilites for further conversation about blockchain adoption in the sphere. Our infrastructure includes smart contracts that facilitate seamless ticket purchasing, management, and validation, eliminating intermediaries and reducing costs. The use of blockchain ensures a transparent and tamper-proof record of all transactions, allowing customers to verify ticket ownership and offers additional features, like automated flight delay/cancellation insurance to incentivise early adopters.

# Key Features
- Decentralized Ticket Purchase: Customers can purchase airline tickets directly from airlines through our blockchain-based system, eliminating the need for intermediaries and reducing fees.
